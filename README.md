Introduction
MRRS aims to provide users with a platform where they can search for words in any language and get results in different languages. The service solves the challenge of scheduled reception times across language barriers, allowing users to view dishes without language barriers. Unlike traditional recipe search engines that work in one language, MRRS will use advanced natural language algorithms to understand and retrieve relevant culinary information from different languages, thereby increasing cooking knowledge around the world.
